### Creating recommendation system using Instacart order data

This is the repository for the final project for the Master's level Data Mining course at The University of Chicago. Our goal is to build a real-time recommendation system that makes personalized purchasing suggestions based on items already added to cart. 
## Project scope
Our approach can be summarized as:
There are five sections in our project:

#### 1. **Data Collection**

The data used in this project is collected through the [Instacart Market Basket Analysis Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis).

#### 2. **Feature Engineering/Customer Classification**
#### 3. **Market Basket Analysis/Recommendation Engine**
